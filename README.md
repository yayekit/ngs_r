# NGS Data Analysis with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to analyze Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. It showcases a complete workflow from raw NGS data preprocessing to feature engineering and model training using XGBoost. The project is implemented in R and focuses on bioinformatics applications.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ngs-ml-analysis.git
   cd ngs-ml-analysis
   ```

2. Install required R packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("xgboost", "caret", "tidyverse", "Biostrings", "GenomicRanges", "ShortRead", "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38"))
   ```

## Usage

To run the complete analysis pipeline:

1. Place your raw NGS data files in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```R
   source("src/data_preprocessing.R")
   ```
3. Run the feature engineering script:
   ```R
   source("src/feature_engineering.R")
   ```
4. Train the model:
   ```R
   source("src/model_training.R")
   ```
5. Evaluate the model:
   ```R
   source("src/model_evaluation.R")
   ```

## Scripts

- `data_preprocessing.R`: Handles loading and preprocessing of raw NGS data, including quality checks and adapter removal.
- `feature_engineering.R`: Extracts and creates relevant features from the preprocessed NGS data for machine learning.
- `model_training.R`: Trains an XGBoost model on the engineered features.
- `model_evaluation.R`: Evaluates the trained model's performance using various metrics.

## Data

- Raw data: Place your FASTQ files in the `data/raw/` directory.
- Processed data: Preprocessed and feature-engineered data will be saved in the `data/processed/` directory.

## Model

This project uses XGBoost for machine learning tasks. The model is trained to [briefly describe the prediction task, e.g., "predict gene expression levels based on DNA sequence features"].

## Results

Analysis results, including performance metrics and visualizations, can be found in the `results/` directory.
